# C-Parallel-Vector-Sort-And-Search

The "C-Parallel-Vector-Sort-And-Search" repository, created by bwallison, is a project focused on parallelizing vector sorting and searching algorithms using the C programming language. The repository provides code and resources specifically tailored for achieving efficient parallel sorting and searching operations on large vectors.

The repository includes implementations of parallel algorithms and techniques designed to speed up the sorting and searching process. Users can explore and utilize these algorithms to efficiently sort and search large vectors in parallel, potentially improving performance compared to sequential algorithms.

Additionally, the repository offers demonstrations/ benchmarks to help users understand and compare the performance benefits of parallel algorithms in vector processing.
